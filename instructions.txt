1. Create a new repository on Github.
2. Open Git Bash and change working directory to where your files are.
3. $git init # initializes this location as a local repository.
4. $ git add -A # Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit.
5. $ git commit -m "First commit"
6. So far you haven't linked this local repo to the giHub repo. 
   Below assigns "origin" to the remote repo.
   $ git remote add origin "https://github.com/smoham12/PetProjectRepo"
7. $ git remote -v #This will show you the remote repo
8. $ git push origin master
   # Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin
9. Now your code is pushed onto github master branch.

To create Branch
10. git branch #to see list of all available branches
11. git branch newBranch #to create a new branch locally named "newBranch"
12. newBranch is identical to master and it is only local at this point. Modify newBranch locally 
13. now commit the changes locally:
    $git status
    $git add -A
    $git commit -m "new branch commits"
14. $git push --set-upstream origin newBranch
good bye
